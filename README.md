# Research Engine (R.E.)
## My CS50 Final Project

R.E. is a platform built specifically for those who deal with writing academic (and nonacademic) papers on a daily basis. Whether you are a PhD student who writes their final paper, a journalist working for a local newspaper, a screenwriter, or a serious Amazon reviewer, ‚ÄúResearch Engine‚Äù (if deployed üòä) will definitely try to make the process of working on large texts easier for you. 

R.E. helps you to cite different kinds of text-sources. Currently, R.E. can work with four: books, chapters in edited books, articles, and webpages. 
The resulted reference will always be given in two variations: APA (American Psychological Association) and MLA (Modern Language Association).

Built with Django & JS.
