# Research Engine (R.E.)
## My CS50 Final Project

R.E. is a platform built specifically for those who deal with writing academic (and nonacademic) on a daily basis. Whether you are a PhD student who writes their final paper, a journalist working for a local newspaper, a screenwriter, or a serious Amazon reviewer, ‚ÄúResearch Engine‚Äù (if deployed üòä) will definitely try to make the process of working on large texts easier for you. 

### Here is a brief review of all R.E. key features:

### ‚Ä¢ Quick References
Without even signing up for R.E., you are able to gain access to what it does best: namely, helping you to cite properly given text-source. Currently, R.E. can work with four kinds of text-based sources: books, chapters in edited books, articles, and webpages. You just need to choose between whose 4 types and fill in the form. The resulted reference will always be given in two variations: APA (American Psychological Association) and MLA (Modern Language Association).

### ‚Ä¢ Sources
If you want to save a source and its reference for later use - no problem! Maybe you‚Äôd want to also add a link to this source or even upload a file containing this source ‚Äì this would work smoothly! Delete or edit the source later ‚Äì yes of course!

### ‚Ä¢ Workspaces
When signed up, users will be invited to create their workspaces. The workspace is a main area where they will gather all their studies. It combines everything one needs to succeed at writing any text: people, papers, sources, and a bunch of other features. The workspace could be a place where multiple members collaborate on writing different papers, or it could turn into a fortress of solitude. But remember: you will be able to invite or share your workspace at any given time. And one more feature the developer is especially proud of: int the actions area of your workspace, under a regular looking anchor tag, lies a possibility of downloading a zip-archive of your space with all files, papers, sources and references uploaded previously.

### ‚Ä¢ Papers
The paper you‚Äôre working on is, of course, the most important part of a workspace. On your paper‚Äôs page, you will experience the following: uploading and saving versions of your paper (pdf or docx), the quantity of pages, words, and characters of your last uploaded file, and choosing sources from your workspace in order to automatically get a bibliography for your page. Lastly, you will definitely find it convenient, that R.E. can automatically add an automatically created bibliography to your last file.

## Technical Information

R.E. is built with Django on the back and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the frontend.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

R.E. massively distinguishes itself from all other CS50W projects: neither social network, nor e-commerce site, it somehow keeps CS50W spirit: it‚Äôs simply and beautiful. The complexity of the project is really not so complicated to describe: R.E. on the backend part contains six (6!) Django apps (‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù, ‚Äúfile_handling‚Äù, ‚Äúpaper_work‚Äù, ‚Äúwork_space‚Äù and ‚Äúuser_management) and two Python helper modules (‚Äúutils‚Äù, ‚Äúcitation‚Äù), whose files are used across all apps. R.E has fifteen (15!) models altogether.

### R.E Applications

#### ‚Ä¢ user_management

This app does what it‚Äôs called: manages everything related to User model: registration, logging in, logging out, account settings (editing personal info), password changing, forgetting, and resetting. 
The last feature works as it should: R.E. sends a user email with a link and instructions on how to reset an account password (see PasswordResetCode model).
helpers.py contains secondary functions for the main views.py file.

#### ‚Ä¢ work_space

The app contains one of the main models of the project (WorkSpace) and two other models (Invitation and ShareSourcesCode) allowing users to invite to or share a workspace. 

Secondary files: helpers.py, source_creation.py, and source_sharing.py help prevent views.py from having different layers of abstraction in one place.

friendly_dir.py allows you to create a temporary directory with all workspace related data, create a zip-file from it, download it, and then delete all that in less than a second.

#### ‚Ä¢ paper_work

The app manages two important modals: Paper and Bibliography (connected via OnetoOne model field).
The separate bibliography.py file makes it possible to create, get, clear, or update bibliography objects.

Besides that, the app concentrates on Paper class. It allows you to create, rename, and archive it, transfer it to another workspace, clear file's history, change its citation style (APA/MLA) and much more.

#### ‚Ä¢ bookshelf

‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù definitely has the most complex model structure. It uses [multi-table inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance) in order to store different types of sources:
class Source is a parent base class that has four child classes (Book, Article, Chapter, Webpage). Using _cast_ method one can access the child class of any source-object.
Besides that, there is a Reference model with a one-to-one relation to every source object that stores both APA and MLA endnotes.
source_alteration.py, source_citation.py, source_copying.py and source_creation.py helping views.py cope with all data.

#### ‚Ä¢ file_handling

Since uploading different files is a key feature of R.E., there is a separate ‚Äúfile_handling‚Äù app for this purpose. It deals with both .pdf and .docx files, storing and analyzing them (counting words, pages, characters, etc.) 

#### ‚Ä¢ website
This app contains neither models nor forms. Its main purpose in life ‚Äì to render!


### R.E. Modules

There are also two extra Python modules created for R.E., so any app can access them.

#### ‚Ä¢ utils

Cleans data submitted via different Django forms (data_cleaning.py), provides the functionality of Django messages (messages.py) and keeps the whole project secure (verification.py, decorators.py) checking if the user has the right to access given data.

#### ‚Ä¢ citation
Creates APA and MLA references. It‚Äôs built as a separate module, because this functionality use both the bookshelf and the website app (‚Äúquick reference‚Äù page).

### Frontend

On the frontend side, R.E. is made of Django Template Language (ten html files extend layout.html), CSS and JavaScript.
website.js ‚Äì is a main js file with cross-page functions. Other js files improve the user experience on every single R.E. page.
